<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;">Dear customer,<br />
<br />
<strong>Xometry Supplies</strong> is winding down its operations and is no longer accepting new orders or RFQs.<br />
<br />
Existing orders will continue to be fulfilled. If you are looking for material that you are unable to source, we can connect you to any vendors we believe might have what you are looking for.<br />
<br />
Please note that the X<strong>ometry Job Board is unaffected</strong> by this change and remains open to bringing work to our Partner Network.<br />
<br />
Send any questions you may have to <u>Supplies@xometry.com</u>.<br />
<br />
We thank you for your patronage of Xometry Supplies.<br />
<br />
Best,â€¯<br />
Xometry Supplies Team</body>
