<p>Thank you for submitting your QMS and for inquiring about the status. We are receiving a high volume of QMS documentation and are working on reviewing them. A member of my team will reach out if we have any questions or concerns about your QMS. If you do not receive an email from a member of my team regarding the QMS, you may assume it meets our requirements. You're all set!</p>

<p>Thanks and have a great day!</p>
