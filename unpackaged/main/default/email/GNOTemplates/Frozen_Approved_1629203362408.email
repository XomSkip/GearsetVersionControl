<br />
<b>First things first - Invoicing!&nbsp;</b>Please fill out the link below to register for invoicing through Concur, if you haven't done so in the past:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/7TZYST2" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/7TZYST2</a><br />
Once you have registered, refer to the attached document for &quot;Invoicing How Tos.&quot;<br />
<br />
<b>Secondly</b>, make sure you complete your profile in its entirety (machinery, certifications, etc.).<br />
<br />
Here are a few recommendations to optimize your experience on Xometry's platform:<br />
<br />
<b>1)</b>&nbsp;Initially, please allow some time for Xometry to receive new orders and subsequently place that work on your board. The price listed for each job represents the total amount paid for the job including material and finish. â€‹<br />
<br />
<b>2)&nbsp;</b>All jobs are first come, first serve. Don't be surprised if you receive an email notifying you that a job has been placed on your board, only to discover that the job is no longer there. Many of the more attractive (i.e. profitable) jobs are taken quickly.<br />
<br />
<b>3)</b>&nbsp;We offer live engineering support on every order. If you have any issues or questions about a job, please let the engineering team know and they will happily help you work through them. You can reach them directly at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:work@xometry.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">work@xometry.com</a>.<br />
<br />
<b>4)&nbsp;</b>While viewing jobs, always click on the top left of each jobs' row to see more details including quantities, finishes, any notes regarding material or quality documentation.<br />
<br />
<b>5)&nbsp;</b>If the price for a job is too low, the best thing you can do is reject it and make a counteroffer. This is a mutually beneficial behavior as it strengthens our pricing algorithm and gives you the chance to win the work at your suggested price (this happens more often than you would think!).<br />
<br />
<b>6)&nbsp;</b>If you have any non-engineering questions regarding the Xometry platform or your account, feel free to contact me directly at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:tseipp@xometry.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">tseipp@xometry.com</a>.<br />
<br />
<b>7)</b>&nbsp;I recommend reading our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.xometry.com/partner-guide" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Partner Guide</a>&nbsp;thoroughly. You can review everything from how job offers work and inspection standards to packaging policies and invoicing processes.<br />
<br />
PS - Remember to get paid for your trial part!! You can do this by adding the part as a line item on the invoice you submit for your first job. You may also submit it separately if you choose.<br />
<br />
Last but not least, WELCOME BACK TO THE NETWORK!! We are so excited to work with you!<br />
<br />
Thanks,</body></html>
