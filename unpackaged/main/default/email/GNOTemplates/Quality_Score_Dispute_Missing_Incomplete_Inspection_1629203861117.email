<br />
I reviewed your case and saw that this job was rejected due to a missing/incomplete inspection report. Please make sure to upload a complete inspection report for every part that you make with us and follow the guidelines in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.xometry.com/partner-guide" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Partner Guide</a>&nbsp;to ensure that this does not happen again in the future.<br />
<br />
Please let me know if you have any other questions or concerns, thanks and have a great day!</p></body></html>
