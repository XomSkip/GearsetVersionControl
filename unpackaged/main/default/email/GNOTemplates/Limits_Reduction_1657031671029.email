<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;">Good afternoon<br />
<br />
Based on a review of partner accounts, your job limits have been reduced to 1/$5,000 based on a low quality and/or low OTS score. &nbsp;The intention of reducing limits is to prevent further reduction in score and the opportunity to work with our Partner Management team on how to improve your scores and success in the network.<br />
<br />
It is important to Xometry to understand where our partners are in their day-to-day business, so that we can ensure we are providing the resources and support necessary for success.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Please reach out to support@xometry.com or to me directly with any questions or concerns you may have.<br />
<br />
We look forward to working with you!<br />
