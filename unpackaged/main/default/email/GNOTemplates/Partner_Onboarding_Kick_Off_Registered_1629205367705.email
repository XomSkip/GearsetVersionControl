<p>Thanks for your interest in completing our New Partner Onboarding process. To get started, all you need to do is request to complete a test part by completing&nbsp;<b><a href="https://pages.xometry.com/request-test-part" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">this form</a></b>. We will actually send you the raw material for all CNC Mill, CNC Lathe, Flat Sheet Metal, and Bent Sheet Metal test parts!</p>
