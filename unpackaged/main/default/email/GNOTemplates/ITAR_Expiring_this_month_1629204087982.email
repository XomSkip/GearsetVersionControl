<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;"><p>Hello,</p>

<p>I just wanted to give you a heads up that your ITAR certification with Xometry is about to expire at the end of this month. Please send us a copy of your newest certification so we can update our system and you can continue to see ITAR work.</p>

<p>If you have not yet received your new letter and already have/plan on renewing your registration, please let me know and I will extend your expiration for 2 months. If we do not receive your new letter by the end of the extension period, ITAR work will be removed from your job board.</p>

<p>Please let me know if you have any questions, thanks.</p></body></html>
