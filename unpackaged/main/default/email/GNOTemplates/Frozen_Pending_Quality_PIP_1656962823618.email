<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;">Your Xometry account &nbsp;has been temporarily Frozen due to quality concerns. &nbsp;In an effort to improve overall quality of product, provide the best service possible to our customers and assure partners are being given every opportunity to succeed, Xometry has implemented recurring one-on-one sessions with partners whose Quality score and/or RMA ratio need improving. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
The intention of these sessions is for our team to work with your team to identify why rejections are occurring and create corrective actions to avoid future recurrence, to ensure your account remains in good standing. &nbsp;We also hope to better understand the gaps and obstacles that you may be facing with regard to Xometry customer quality requirements.<br />
<br />
Please respond with some dates/times that work best for an initial meeting, and I will reply with an email invitation.<br />
