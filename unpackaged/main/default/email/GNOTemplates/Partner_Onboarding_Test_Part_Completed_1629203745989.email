<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;"><p>We are looking forward to receiving your part.&nbsp; Once we receive your part our inspection team will use a CMM to check all dimensions. You should receive an approval decision, either way, within 2 weeks after we receive the part.</p>

<p>Again, remember to reference the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.xometry.com/partner-guide" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Partner Guide</a>&nbsp;or go to the community page at&nbsp;<a href="http://community.xometry.com/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">community.xometry.com</a>&nbsp;if you have questions about the inspection and/or shipping policies and procedures. Feel free to reach out if you believe that your part should have been reviewed already so I can make sure that we did, in fact, receive the part.</p></body></html>
