<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;">The Partner Management Team, at Xometry, has been contacted multiple times in the past 2 weeks, regarding poor and inaccurate communication from High Tech Machining. Providing exceptional Customer experience and on-time delivery is paramount to our Xometry core values as is our commitment to monitor Partner performance for any shortcomings in these areas.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It is critical for our Partner Network to provide timely and accurate updates and reply to our inquiries in a timely fashion, particularly when a job is running behind, so that we can accurately update our customers. &nbsp;Failing to do so may result in removal from the network.<br />
<br />
If you are encountering an issue with a job or during completion of a job, please contact us immediately, so that we may assist.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
We appreciate your cooperation in this matter.<br />
