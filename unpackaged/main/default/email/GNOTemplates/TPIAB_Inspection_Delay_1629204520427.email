<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;"><p>Thanks for inquiring about your test part. We have been experiencing a delay in getting the test parts inspected due to limited staff being on-site. We are undergoing a staff training this Thursday, 8/13, to ensure that test parts are processed in a timely manner. You will get a response from us about the status of your test part by the end of the week. If it has not been inspected yet, it will be first in line to get inspected in next Monday's queue.</p>

<p>We appreciate your patience and will be in touch soon!</p></body></html>
