<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;"><p>Hello,</p>

<p>We require that all Partners interested in completing work through Xometry's job board have a Quality Management System. We know this can be a difficult task and have created a resource to help you&nbsp;<b><a href="https://community.xometry.com/kb/articles/224-xometrys-quality-management-system-requirements" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">create a Quality Management System</a></b>&nbsp;for your business. In this help article, you will find a list of our QMS requirements as well as templates to help you document a Quality Management System that meets our standards.</p>

<p>Once you have set up and implemented a Quality Management System, please send your QMS documentation to us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:partner-qms@xometry.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">partner-qms@xometry.com</a>.</p>

<p>Let us know if you have any questions!</p></body></html>
