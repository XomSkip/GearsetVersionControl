<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;"><p>Thanks for reaching out to us with your question. The PSS Score is based on all the jobs that you have completed in the past 30 days or your last 10 jobs, whichever is greater.</p>

<p>The Communication Score Component is based on items that can be tracked by our computer system. These are the 3 Job Status Updates ( Raw Material Received, Production Started, &amp; Inspection Started) and the Automated Email sent exactly 2 days before the Job is Due (Will Job XXXXX ship on time?).</p>

<p>Providing the Job updates in a timely manner and answering the Ship on Time email honestly, will improve your Communication score.</p>
