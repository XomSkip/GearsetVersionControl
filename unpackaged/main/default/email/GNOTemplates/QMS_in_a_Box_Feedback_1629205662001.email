<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;"><p>Hello!</p>

<p>Thank you for sending in your QMS documentation. We noticed you used our QMS in a Box templates to meet the requirement. I was reviewing the documentation you provided and noticed that the main information that was updated from the examples outlined in the template was your name and Company Overview.</p>

<p>Can you confirm that the standards and procedures that you submitted with QMS in a Box are being implemented and followed at your facility? If they are not, I ask that you update your provided documentation to reflect your business's actual operational standards and procedures.</p>

<p>Please let me know if you have any questions. I hope to hear from you soon.<br />
Thanks and have a great day!</p></body></html>
