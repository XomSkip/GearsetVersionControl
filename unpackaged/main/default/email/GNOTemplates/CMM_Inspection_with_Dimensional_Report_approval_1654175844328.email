<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;">Hi there!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It looks like your shop has recently applied for CMM Inspection with Dimensional Report capabilities, that's great! Before I can approve your inspection capabilities we require 2 documents<br />
- the calibration certificate<br />
- a photo of the CMM<br />
And it is very important to understand that for a CMM report to be used in place of the Dimensional Report, the bubbled drawing numbering must be followed and the CMM report must include the drawing notes as applicable. You can reply to this email with the documents attached and I will update your account accordingly. If you have any questions please let me know.
