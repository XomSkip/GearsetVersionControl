<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;">Hi there,<br />
<br />
I reviewed your case, and saw that the part was originally rejected by our inspection team but then accepted by our engineering review board. Since there was no further action required on our end (rework, remake, etc.), I have updated our system and your PSS score should reflect this change (typically within 24 hours, but could take up to a week).<br />
<br />
Please let me know if you have any other questions or concerns, thanks and have a great day!</body></html>
