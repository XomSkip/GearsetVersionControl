<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;"><p>Hi there!</p>

<p>We see that you have not yet set up your banking information with us through Xometry's Shop Finances platform in your Partner Portal. Job payments with us are now automatically paid through a platform called Stripe. You will need to set up your banking information with us in order to receive payment for any work you complete through Xometry.</p>

<p>Please note that only one Partner Account is assigned per shop - ensure that you are setting up your banking information in your active Partner Account.</p>

<p>Please review this&nbsp;<b><a href="https://community.xometry.com/kb/articles/151-signing-up" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">help article</a></b>&nbsp;for instruction on how to set up your banking information with Shop Finances. You can learn more about Xometry Payouts in the&nbsp;<b><a href="https://community.xometry.com/kb/payouts" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Help Center</a></b>&nbsp;in Xometry's Partner Community. Navigate to different help article topics and FAQs using the left-hand menu.</p>

<p>We are happy to process your payments once this is set up! Please reach out if you have any issues.</p>

<p>Best,</p></body></html>
