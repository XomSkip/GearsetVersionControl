<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;">Your Xometry account has recently been reviewed to assess our partnership and at this time we believe it is in our mutual best interest to part ways. &nbsp;The underlying reasons for this decision were excessive late delivery with key customers and communication challenges.<br />
<br />
Providing exceptional Customer Experience and On Time delivery is paramount to our Xometry core values as is our commitment to monitor Partner performance for any shortcomings in these areas.<br />
<br />
You may apply for reinstatement in 6-months, pending that you can provide documentation showing systemic/process changes in your operation, which will improve quality and OTS. &nbsp;Those documents will be reviewed and a determination made about reinstatement at that time.<br />
<br />
We wish you and your shop the best and we are grateful for the work you completed for us.<br />
