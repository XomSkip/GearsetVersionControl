<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;">I have attached a WO for this job to this email. When you finish production, please send me the inspection report and photos of the part so I can generate a shipping label for you. Once this job ships please email accounting@xometry.com with the WO in order for it to be paid out. Please start a new email chain with a new subject when you do so.</body>
