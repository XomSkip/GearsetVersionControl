<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;">I am sorry to hear of the non-conformance. I will escalate this with our Returns Manager to review as an RMA. Once approved we will be able to start work on remaking your part (or looking at alternative ways of making this right)&nbsp;and launch corrective action so that this will not repeat.&nbsp;In the meantime please send photos and inspection reports of your parts to indicate where it is non-conforming.<br />
