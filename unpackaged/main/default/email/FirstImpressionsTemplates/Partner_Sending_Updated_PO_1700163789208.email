<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;">I have updated your PO and attached it to this email for your reference. Please note that although you were approved this time we cannot guarantee that all PO increase requests will be approved. Instead, please use the "Provide Feedback" before accepting the job. As we resolved this issue can you please confirm if you are on track to continue production?</body>
