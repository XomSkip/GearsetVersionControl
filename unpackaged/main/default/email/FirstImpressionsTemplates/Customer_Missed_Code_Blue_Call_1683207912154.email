<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;">We have encountered a delay with your order and I am working on creating a recovery plan. I was hoping to get a better understanding of your deadlines.&nbsp;I would like to know if partial shipments of your order would allow us to meet your needs. If so, what day do you need which part, and how many of those parts?</body>
