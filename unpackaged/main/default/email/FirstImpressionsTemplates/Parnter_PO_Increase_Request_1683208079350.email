<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;">If you send me a breakdown of your costs with machine time and a material quote from Xometry Supplies (in addition to a quote from a local vendor if relevant) I can request approval for a PO increase. Please send this information over as soon as possible. I would like to stress that a Xometry Supplies quote is required for any increase beyond $750 even if you don't plan on using it.</body>
