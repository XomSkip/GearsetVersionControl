<p>&nbsp;1.) Authorize Xometry&nbsp;to dispose of the molds at our discretion.</p>

<p>&nbsp;2.) Have the molds shipped back to the customer.</p>

<p>&nbsp; <b>&nbsp;~ Molds shipped back to the customer require shipping instructions and shipping method at time of disposition.</b></p>

<p><b>&nbsp; &nbsp;~ Molds are shipped at customer expense.</b><br />
