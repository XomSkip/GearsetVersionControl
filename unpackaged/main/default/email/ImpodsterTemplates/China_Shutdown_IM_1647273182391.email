<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;">Dear &lt;Customer Name&gt;,<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As a valued customer of Xometry, it is with sincere regret that we inform you of an unexpected manufacturing shutdown in our Greater China partner network. We have been informed that the Chinese Government has issued a 'stop work' mandate for all of the Shenzhen industrial zones due to a spike in Covid-19 cases. This mandate is in effect for one week and will, unfortunately, impact the delivery of your program.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Your Xometry team is working extremely close with our China operations team as well as our partners directly, to both measure the impact to your project and monitor the situation as it unfolds. As soon as we have a reliable recovery date we will pass it along immediately.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As always, please don't hesitate to reach out with questions or concerns. Our team will be managing this very closely for you.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
<br />
&lt;Team Member&gt;
