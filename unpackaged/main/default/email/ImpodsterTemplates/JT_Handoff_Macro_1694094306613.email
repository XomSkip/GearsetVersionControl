<p>Thank you for placing order #XXXXX-XXXXX with Xometry!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm the DFM Engineer who will be walking you through the following steps to get your tooling kicked off:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Step 1: Hand Over Document Approval</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attached is a document that captures all pertinent information regarding your order.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please review this and confirm that all information is correct.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please reach out immediately if there is anything missing or unclear.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Step 2: Latest CAD Confirmation</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attached you will find the latest CAD data that we have in our ERP for this project.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please confirm that these are the most up-to-date versions of the models.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have 2D drawings and have not yet provided them, we will gladly accept them at this time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Step 3: DFM Review &amp; Approval</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A DFM review for your part(s) will be provided to you within the next 24-48 hours.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The DFM will be used to identify any manufacturability issues/risks prior to tool kick-off.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All issues must be resolved prior to tool kickoff.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note: Tool build timing does not start until DFM is approved.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any delay in resolving these issues may result in the delayed shipment of your parts.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please let me know if you have any questions, and I look forward to working with you on this project.</p>
