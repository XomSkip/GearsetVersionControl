<p>Thank you for placing order #XXXXX-XXXXX with Xometry!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm the DFM Engineer who will be working with you on your new Xometry injection molding project. &nbsp;Please see the following secure link:<br />
https://XXXXX</p>

<p>Please review the items in the shared link above, and I will walk you through the following steps to get your tooling kicked off:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Step 1: Hand Over Document Approval</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Within the folder link is a document that captures all pertinent information regarding your order.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Please review this and confirm that all information is correct.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Please reach out immediately if there is anything missing or unclear.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Step 2: Latest CAD Confirmation</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Within the folder link, you will find the latest CAD data that we have in our ERP for this project.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Please confirm that these are the most up-to-date version of the model.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; If you have 2D drawings and have not yet provided them, we will gladly accept them at this time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Step 3: DFM Review &amp; Approval</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Within the folder link, please see the DFM report provided by the toolmaker on this project.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; At earliest convenience, please review each slide, make textbox comments, add approvals/disapprovals where applicable, and return this document as soon as possible.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The DFM will be used to identify any manufacturability issues/risks prior to tool kick-off.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;All issues must be resolved prior to tool kickoff.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Note: Tool build timing does not start until DFM is approved.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any delay in resolving these issues may result in the delayed shipment of your parts.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please let me know if you have any questions, and I look forward to working with you on this project.</p>
