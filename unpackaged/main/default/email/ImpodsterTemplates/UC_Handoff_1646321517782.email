<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;">Hello {{{Recipient.Name}}},<br />
<br />
Thank you for placing order #XXXXX-XXXXX with Xometry!<br />
<br />
I am the Case Manager who will be working with you to get this Urethane Casting order kicked off. This order is going through a DFM review and there are a few items we need to confirm to move forward.<br />
<br />
Xometry will manufacture the product from the model to the specifications listed below:
<ul>
	<li>+/- 0.010” or +/- 0.003” per inch, whichever is larger, is typical. Irregular or overly-thick geometries may cause deviances or deflection due to shrinkage.</li>
	<li>A shrinkage rate of +0.15% can be expected due to thermal expansion of the liquid, and the response of the flexible mold.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Surface finish is externally smoothed to a satin or matte surface. Grow lines may be present on internal or difficult-to-access features. Polishing or custom finishes must be clearly defined and agreed upon at the point of order.</li>
	<li>The material was quoted as XXXXX</li>
	<li>Attached is the latest CAD. Please confirm they are the latest, and provide any additional items as soon as possible to avoid delays.</li>
</ul>
Please let me know if you have any questions, and I look forward to working with you on this project.</body>
