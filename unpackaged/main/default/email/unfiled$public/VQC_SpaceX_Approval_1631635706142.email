<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;">Hi<br />
<br />
This is now approved for direct shipment and your shipping documents are now available through the partner portal. Please visibly secure the attached eCert to the exterior of the packaging such that the green portion is legible to the SpaceX shipping/receiving department. This eCert serves as a physical placeholder for all quality documents (dimensional inspection reports, material certifications, CoC's, etc), thus no other documents should be included with the shipment other than the packing slip.<br />
<br />
Please let me know if you run into any issues shipping/closing the job.<br />
<br />
Thank you!</body></html>
