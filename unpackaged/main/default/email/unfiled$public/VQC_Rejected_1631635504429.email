<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;">Hello ,<br />
<br />
Thank you for notifying VQC that you are ready for your inspection.<br />
<br />
I have started your inspection and I am very pleased with the final product! I have, however, found a few<br />
revisions that need to be made. Please see the checklist I have attached to this email that goes into detail of<br />
what is still needed. If I can assist you by answering any questions, or once the revisions have been made and<br />
uploaded to the portal, please notify me through this email chain and I will gladly finalize the inspection.</body></html>
