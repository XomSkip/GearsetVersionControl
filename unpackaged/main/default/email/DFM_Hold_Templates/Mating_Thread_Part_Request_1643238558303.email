<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;">Hello,<br />
<br />
Thanks for placing this order with Xometry!<br />
<br />
We are reaching out because we wanted to see if you might have a mating part available to help us ensure the threads we are manufacturing on your order are machined properly since they are outside our standard thread offerings.<br />
<br />
If a mating part is not available, would inspection per best shop practice be acceptable?<br />
<br />
We will not have gaging on hand at this thread size, but will make or use alternate tooling.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thanks,
</body></html>
