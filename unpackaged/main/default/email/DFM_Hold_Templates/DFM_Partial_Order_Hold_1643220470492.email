<p>Hi,</p>

<p>Thanks for ordering with Xometry! In reviewing the parts on the order, we found some manufacturing issues:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Issue 1</li>
</ul>

<p>We would like to move the other parts into production unless you have concerns. Would it be acceptable to proceed with the rest of the order while we address the above issues?<br />
<br />
If we do not hear back from you, we will proceed to hold the entire order to ensure no unintended consequences are made. We will do our best to maintain the current lead time, but may need up to one business day per day of hold on any rescheduled parts.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If we can be of further assistance, please let us know.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</p>
