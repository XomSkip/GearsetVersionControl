<br />
Thank you for placing this order with Xometry!<br />
<br />
We are reaching out because we need the following hardware aspects defined before we can proceed to production:</p>

<br />
We are placing this order ON HOLD, and may need up to one business day of lead time per day on hold. If we do not hear back from you we will follow up and do our best to proceed.&nbsp;
