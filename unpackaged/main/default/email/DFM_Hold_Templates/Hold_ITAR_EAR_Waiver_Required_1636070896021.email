<p>Hello&nbsp; ,<br />
<br />
Thank you for placing this order with Xometry! In completing our DFM review, we noticed that your drawings indicate the parts should be restricted by ITAR/EAR. This requirement was not captured on the order, and so we have placed the order on hold prior to allowing any production team review to take place.<br />
<br />
In order to proceed, we will need you to remove the ITAR markings from your prints, and to reply with the corrected documents attached.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
We will do our best to minimize delay, but may need one business day of lead time per day of hold.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
&nbsp;</p>
