<p>Hello,</p>

<p><br />
Thanks for ordering with Xometry! We are reviewing this order and have been unable to generate a flat-pattern or DXF with bend lines necessary to proceed to production. As a result, we need to place this order ON HOLD.<br />
<br />
Please get back to us at your earliest convenience with a CAD file and flat pattern that we can send to production review. We know the timing of your project is important and we will do our best to minimize any timing impacts, but may need up to one business day per day of hold time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We look forward to your response and will confirm a new ship date or dock date once we are back in production upon resolution.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Best,</p>
