<p>Good Morning,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for your interest in Xometry. I was unable to locate an account or billing profile connected to your email address. Once you have created an account you can set up a billing profile which will prompt the process of a credit application. After you have created your billing profile, you can log into your account and upload your Tax Exemption forms.</p>

<p>You can create an account simply by visiting <a href="https://xometry.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xometry.com</a> and selecting "Sign-In" at the top right of the screen. The first link below gives instructions on how you can establish your billing profile on our website. The second like details how you can add your Tax Exemption documents to your billing profile.&nbsp;</p>
