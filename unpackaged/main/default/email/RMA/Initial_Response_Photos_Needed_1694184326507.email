Good (blank),<br />
<br />
We're so sorry to hear that the parts from your recent order are not to the standard you expect from Xometry and look forward to the opportunity to address your concerns. I have escalated this matter for review and disposition and we will be following up shortly once the evaluation has been completed.<br />
<br />
While our team discusses the best path forward, to expedite the process for you would it be possible to provide some photos of the parts for us to document and evaluate the nonconformance you mentioned?<br />
