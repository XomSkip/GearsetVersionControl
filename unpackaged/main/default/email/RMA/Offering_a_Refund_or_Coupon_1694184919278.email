Hi,<br />
<br />
I'm sorry for any inconvenience caused by receiving parts from us that are not up to our quality standards.<br />
We would either be able to have the part reworked for you, or we can process a refund. If you would like a refund, we will send you a shipping label, and as soon as the parts are shipped, we will have accounting process a refund for you. If you are able to rework the parts yourself, we would be happy to provide a credit on a future order with us.<br />
<br />
At your convenience please let us know how you would like to proceed.<br />
<br />
