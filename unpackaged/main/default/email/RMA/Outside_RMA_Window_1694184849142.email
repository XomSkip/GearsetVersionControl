Thank you for reaching out and bringing your concerns to our attention, we are more than happy to look into your order to address your feedback. I had a chance to review this order and noticed these parts were shipped out on (ship date). At Xometry we have a 30 day RMA window, and although we do evaluate each request on an individual basis the lapse of time between delivery to our customers and receipt of the RMA by us does weigh into our disposition. Having said that, due to this order having shipped over (blank) we will not be moving forward with the RMA.<br />
