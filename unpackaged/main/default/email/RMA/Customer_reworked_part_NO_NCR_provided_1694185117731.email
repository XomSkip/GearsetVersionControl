Thanks for getting back to me, unfortunately we will not be able to honor your RMA request at this time. Whenever parts arrive nonconforming, it's essential for us to receive some tangible evidence to document the issue not only internally but also to validate the nonconformance with our facility. Additionally, we can't honor an RMA request for parts that have been modified post-delivery unless we have received an inspection report prior to that work being completed.<br />
<br />
Having said that, we do understand that project timelines sometimes require our customers to make adjustments on the fly and can empathize with the difficult situation that put you in. Given that, as a courtesy we would like to provide you with a credit code that can be used to reorder the replacement part. I have included that information below as well as instructions on how to apply the credit. If there is anything else we can help with please let us know, and I hope you have a great rest of your week!<br />
