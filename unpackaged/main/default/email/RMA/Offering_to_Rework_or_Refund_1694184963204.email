Hi,<br />
<br />
I'm sorry for any inconvenience caused by receiving parts from us that are not up to our quality standards. To resolve the potential RMA, would the best resolution be for you to have Xometry to get acceptable parts back into your hands, or if you are able to rework the parts, we could offer a credit towards a future order for your accepting them as-is.<br />
<br />
Please let me know how I can help!<br />
