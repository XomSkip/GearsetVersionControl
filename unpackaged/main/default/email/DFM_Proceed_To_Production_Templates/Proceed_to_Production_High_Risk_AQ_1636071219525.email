<br />
Hi <font color="#e74c3c">Insert Customer Name</font>,<br />
<br />
Thank you for placing this order with Xometry! In completing our DFM review, we noticed a few areas that are challenging from a manufacturing perspective.&nbsp;These issues could result in manufacturing feasibility concerns and even if possible, could result in lead time concerns.<br />
<br />
**ADD IMAGES THAT HIGHLIGHT CONCERN AREAS OF EACH EXAMPLE IF APPLICABLE**<br />
<br />
In order to confirm or satisfy these concerns, we are proceeding with our tentative DFM Engineering approval to move the parts into production's queue.<br />
<br />
We are providing this early-phase transparency in the event you have straight-forward input that could promptly address the concerns, such as <font color="#e74c3c">Insert: suggest a mfg solution (modify, omit, split, pilot, etc.)&nbsp;</font>or a means to provide additional lead time for the order. Either way, we should have feedback for you within two business days.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you would be open to design modifications to address the above, please let us know as soon as possible so that we can best protect your project timeline.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thank you.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
&nbsp;</p>
