<p>Hello,</p>

<p>Thank you for placing this order with Xometry! We are reaching out because we noticed that your prints have a finish callout on them that was not captured on the order.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We are proceeding to production for standard finish; but if this was not intended, please do not hesitate to reach out and we can help accommodate your needs.</p>

<p>Thanks,<br />
&nbsp;</p>
