<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Thank you for placing this order with Xometry! In completing our DFM review, we noticed a few areas requiring radius additions to be manufacturable via CNC. These areas are captured in the images attached.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<span style="color:#c0392b;">1) ADD IMAGES THAT HIGHLIGHT SHARPS AFFECTED</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#c0392b;">2) NOTE SIZE OF RADII BEING ADDED</span><br />
<br />
We do not anticipate these blends will impact the fitment, form, or functionality of the parts, and to hold your lead time, have approved the minor updates for production. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out and we are happy to assist!</p>

<p><br />
Thank you,<br />
&nbsp;</p>
