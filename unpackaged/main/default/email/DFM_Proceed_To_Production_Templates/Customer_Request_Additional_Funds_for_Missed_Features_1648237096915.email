<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;">Hello,<br />
<br />
Thank you for placing this order with Xometry! In reviewing your order, we noticed that some of the features on the print were not captured on the quoting site properly.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
part 1<br />
issue 1, 2, 3, etc.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
When we requoted this, we came to an adjustment of $XXX. We understand every dollar counts, but wanted to see if your project has any freedom to come closer to our corrected pricing to hold the features to the print.<br />
<br />
We thank you for your consideration, and are happy to answer any questions. Please let us know your thoughts at your earliest convenience, and thank you again for choosing Xometry.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Best,<br />
