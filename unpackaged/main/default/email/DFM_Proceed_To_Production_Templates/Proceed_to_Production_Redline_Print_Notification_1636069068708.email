<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Thank you for placing this order with Xometry! In completing our DFM review, we needed to redline a few aspects to ensure our production team can proceed with confidence.<br />
<br />
Please find attached the redlined drawings that will be used for manufacturing.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have any questions in regards to the redline attached, please let us know and we are happy to assist in any way we can!<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
&nbsp;</p>
