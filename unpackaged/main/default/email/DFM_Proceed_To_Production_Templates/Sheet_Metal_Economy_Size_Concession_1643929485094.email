<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;">Hello,<br />
<br />
Thank you for ordering with Xometry! We were reviewing this order and noticed that parts X,Y have Z (Zmm) material thickness that is not readily available internationally. We will continue with the closest size, A" (Amm), for manufacturing. Please reply at your earliest convenience and advise if this concession is permissible.<br />
<br />
We will try to hold off production for 1-2 days, but following that we will need to continue in order to best achieve your original delivery date. If you have any comments or questions please let us know.<br />
<br />
Thank you,
