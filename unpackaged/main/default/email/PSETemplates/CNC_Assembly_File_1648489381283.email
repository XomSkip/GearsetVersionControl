<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Hello,</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Thanks for submitting an RFQ to us! Unfortunately, your parts are unable to be quoted/manufactured because you uploaded an assembly file. To obtain a quote, each part will need to be separated and uploaded individually.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">If you need Xometry to quote for assembly as well, upload the individual CAD files including the assembly file and drawings to re-submit for manual quote OR you can simply reply to this email with these files and a member of our team will build the quote for you.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Please let us know if you have any additional questions!&nbsp;</span></span></p>
