As a valued client of Xometry, our goal is to keep you updated on any status changes your order may come across. Unfortunately, a manufacturing delay has led us to miss the projected ship date. We are diligently working to have your order in your hands as quickly as possible. We'll provide a second update as soon as we have more information.<br clear="none" />

I have expedited your shipment to next-day to recover as much time as we can to have the parts in your hand.<br clear="none" />

Please accept our apologies for any inconvenience this may cause. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. We are here to assist.<br />
<br />
Best, </span>
