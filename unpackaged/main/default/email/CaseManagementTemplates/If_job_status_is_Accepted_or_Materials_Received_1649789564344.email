<br />
I wanted to take a moment and introduce myself as the supplier quality engineer for job . My role as a Supplier Quality Engineer is to provide you with the support required to deliver our customer's order on time and with impeccable quality!<br />
<br />
If you run into any issues with the production of this order - you can contact me using the information below and Iâ€™ll get back to you quickly.<br />
<br />
With all of the recent disruptions to the supply chain, we are proactively reaching out to our partners with greater frequency to see how we can help you - with the end goal of on-time delivery for our customers.<br />
<br />
<b>What do we need from you?</b><br />
<br />
Please confirm you have initiated your material order<br />
Once the order is confirmed please provide us with the expected vendor delivery date<br />
If there is a delay to your order - Please contact us immediately so we can provide solutions<br />
<br />
<b>Special Situations - If applicable </b>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Finishing - Please provide us with the lead time for your finishing<br />
