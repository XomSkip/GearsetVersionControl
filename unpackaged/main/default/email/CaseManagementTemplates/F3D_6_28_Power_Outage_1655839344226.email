<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Thank you for using Xometry!<br />
<br />
We are reaching out to let you know that due to a planned power outage at one of our largest suppliers we are going to be shipping your order on 06/29. We have upgraded your shipping speed to standard overnight to maintain the original delivery date of 06/30. We appreciate your understanding as we work to deliver parts in a timely fashion while accommodating our shops needs.<br />
<br />
Please let us know if you have any questions.</p>

<p>Best,<br />
&nbsp;</p>
