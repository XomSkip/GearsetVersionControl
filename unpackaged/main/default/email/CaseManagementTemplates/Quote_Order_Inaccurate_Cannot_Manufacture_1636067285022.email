<p>Dear {{{Recipient.FirstName}}}<b>,</b></p>

<p>First of all, allow me to thank you so much for your recent order XXX. I never like having to write this email, but itâ€™s unfortunately sometimes necessary. We have made multiple attempts to manufacture your parts and we are unable to continue.</p>

<p>Our engineers have looked into the issues and determined we cannot manufacture your parts due to XXXX.</p>

<p>We would like to set up a time to discuss with you and your team to see what we can do to rectify the situation.</p>

<p>Again, we apologize we were not able to foresee these issues with your part and hope we can resolve them with you. We look forward to hearing from you.</p>

<p>Thank you,</p>

<p>{{{Sender.FirstName}}}<br />
Xometry Customer Support</p>
