<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;">Good morning (Insert Customer's Name Here),<br />
<br />
I wanted to reach out to you in regards to this order. Unfortunately, our system does not show that it shipped last night as expected. I am looking into the root cause and will follow up with an update as soon as possible. In the meantime, I have upgraded shipping to reduce the delay.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I want to apologize for any inconvenience that this may cause you. Please feel free to reach out with any questions or concerns.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
(Insert your name here)
