<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;">Good xxxxxxx,<br />
<br />
I wanted to reach out to you in regards to this order. Unfortunately, it is not going to make it out the door today and I am looking into the root cause and will be in touch when I have another update. In the meantime, I have upgraded shipping in the hopes to still meet your expected delivery date.<br />
<br />
I want to apologize for any inconvenience that this may cause you. Please feel free to reach out with any questions or concerns.<br />
<br />
Sincerely,<br />
<br />
Katy</body>
