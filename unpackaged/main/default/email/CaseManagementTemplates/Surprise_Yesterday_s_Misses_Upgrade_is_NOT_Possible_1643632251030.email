<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;">Good morning XXXXXX,<br />
<br />
I wanted to reach out to you in regards to your order. Unfortunately, our system does not show that it shipped last night as expected. I am looking into the root cause and will follow up with an update as soon as possible.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I want to apologize for any inconvenience that this may cause you. Please feel free to reach out with any questions or concerns.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
&nbsp;</body>
