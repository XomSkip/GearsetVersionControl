Thank you for reaching out to us - we appreciate your interest in Xometry.
 
We would be happy to help you get a quote started. My first recommendation is to get an account setup here: https://get.xometry.com/register . This will ultimately allow you to re-visit quotes, place orders, save parts for future orders, ect. Once setup, you can go to our Instant Quoting Page, upload the 3D files, and start getting instant quotes for your product in a variety of quantities and materials.
 
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact our support team at support@xometry.com or simply reply to this email with any concerns - I am here to assist you!
 
Thank you,
