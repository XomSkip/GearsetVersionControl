<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;">Hi there,<br />
<br />
The Xometry team has reviewed your test part and unfortunately, it did not pass inspection. I have attached your inspection report to this email for your review. Based on the feedback, it was primarily due to <strong>OOT dimension(s)</strong>.<br />
<br />
We're happy to offer you a second opportunity. Simply email <strong>partneronboarding@xometry.com</strong> with your <strong>Partner ID</strong> and your <strong>second attempt request</strong>.<br />
<br />
We also offer daily <a href="https://community.xometry.com/events/57-xometry-expedite-support-quality-all-partner-questions-support-hour">Quality Support Hour</a> &nbsp;every Monday - Friday from 3pm-4pm ET where you can review your results and ask questions with a Xometry expert.<br />
<br />
Best,<br />
<br />
The Xometry Team<br />
<br />
