<br />
Thank you for reaching out to Xometry. Upon reviewing your purchase order we noticed a discrepancy with the itemization of your order. If you could send us a revised PO referencing <em><strong>each line item along with their quantity and unit pricing</strong></em> at your earliest convenience we would greatly appreciate it.<br />
<br />
If we may be of any additional assistance please don't hesitate to reach out.<br />
<br />
The quote in reference is attached below for your convenience.<br />

Regards,<br />
