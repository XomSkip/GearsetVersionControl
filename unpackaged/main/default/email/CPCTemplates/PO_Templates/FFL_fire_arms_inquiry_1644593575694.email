<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;">Hello,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thank you for your recent order with Xometry.<br />
<br />
However, our team has flagged this as a violation of Xometry's firearm policy and has cancelled and refunded your order. You should see a refund within 1-3 business days. Xometry does not carry a Federal Firearms License (FFL) and, therefore, cannot produce any product that requires an FFL. As a general rule, this encompasses receivers, suppressors, bump stocks, automatic conversion kits, weapon replicas, and any serialized component of a weapon.<br />
