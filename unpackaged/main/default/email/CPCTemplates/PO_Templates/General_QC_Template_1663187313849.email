<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;">Hello,<br />
<br />
Thanks for reaching out to us! Our team was reviewing your PO and found that the terms and conditions called out some quality clauses that aren't applied to this order, so they aren't being taken into account. Before we submit the order, we wanted to verify whether these were needed or OK to proceed as the quote is set up now.<br />
<br />
Do you require:
<ol>
	<li>ITAR?&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Material certifications? (If yes to material certifications, do you require DFARS or Standard certs?)</li>
	<li>Certificates of conformance?</li>
	<li>First Article Inspection?</li>
	<li>Traceability?</li>
</ol>
<br />
Once confirmed, we can process this order accordingly and send a confirmation email.<br />
<br />
Thank you for choosing Xometry, we look forward to hearing back from you!</body>
