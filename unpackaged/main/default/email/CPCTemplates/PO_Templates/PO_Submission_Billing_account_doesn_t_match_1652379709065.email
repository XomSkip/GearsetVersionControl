<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
Thank you for contacting Xometry! We have received and reviewed your purchase order, but it appears that the billing address we have on file for your company does not match what was listed on this PO.<br />
<br />
The billing address we have on file is as follows:<br />
<br />
PASTE ADDRESS<br />
<br />
This is the address listed on your PO:<br />
<br />
PASTE ADDRESS<br />
<br />
Could you please confirm which address is correct?<br />
<br />
Thank you and we look forward to hearing from you!&nbsp;</p>
