Thank you for submitting your order! While reviewing your PO, we noticed your shipping terms are DDP.&nbsp;<br clear="none" />

We offer shipping through FedEx typically unless you have your own account number through a collect shipping service.&nbsp;<br clear="none" />

Do you have a FedEx, UPS, or USPS account number that we can ship your order on instead? If not, we have other shipping options available to discuss.<br clear="none" />

Thank you and I look forward to hearing back!
