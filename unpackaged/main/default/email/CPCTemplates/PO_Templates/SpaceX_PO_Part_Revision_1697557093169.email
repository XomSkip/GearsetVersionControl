<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;">Hello,<br />
<br />
Thank you for sending your PO! We noticed while processing that your PO does not call out the Part Revision in the allocated "Part REV" filed. In order for us to provide the E-Certifications related to your order, we need to have these listed on your PO. Can you please send us a revised PO that includes these revisions in the allotted field?<br />
<br />
<em><strong>*Please note this is different then the revision listed on the file name.</strong></em><br />
<br />
Regards,</body>
