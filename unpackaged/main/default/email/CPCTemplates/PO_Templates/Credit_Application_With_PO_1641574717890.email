<p>Hello ____,<br />
<br />
Thank you for sending over this PO - we appreciate your interest in Xometry!<br />
<br />
Our staff reviewed your request and noticed that ______ does not have an active Billing Account. In order to move forward with placing your order using PO on Net 30 Terms, users are required to submit a <a href="https://support.xometry.com/hc/en-us/articles/360059449413-How-to-establish-credit-terms-and-pay-with-a-purchase-order-PO-"><strong>Digital Billing Profile Set-Up Form</strong></a>. Once approved - we can flag any other user under your company as PO Approved, facilitating the order process in the future.</p>

<ul>
	<li>If you are tax-exempt, please send us your tax exemption certificate/number so that we may flag your account as tax-exempt. This will prevent your order from automatically being charged tax during check-out.</li>
	<li>If you are not interested in applying for Net Terms, you can also contact our support line at 240-252-1138 to place your order over the phone using a credit card.</li>
