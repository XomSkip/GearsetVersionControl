<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;">Hello,<br />
<br />
Thank you for contacting Xometry. I have attached the requested documents to this e-mail.<br />
<br />
As a reference for any future jobs, please click on this link https://community.xometry.com/kb/articles/531-shipping-instructions as it will walk you through creating a label through your portal. This will reduce the risk of a delayed shipment resulting from waiting for a shipping label to be manually created and provided to you.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
We kindly ask that you report any issues with creating your labels in the future. Contact us at our help center here: https://community.xometry.com/kb<br />
<br />
Please do not hesitate to reach out to us with any other questions or concerns you may have.<br />
<br />
Thank you,</body>
