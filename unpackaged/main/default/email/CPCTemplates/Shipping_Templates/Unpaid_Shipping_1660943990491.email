If youâ€™d prefer to use your shipping account, please provide your account number and our team will redirect the charges to be processed through your account. Alternatively, if you purchased this order using a PO, you may choose to "prepay and add." With your written confirmation, our team will simply invoice you for the unpaid charges at the time of invoicing.<br clear="none" />
