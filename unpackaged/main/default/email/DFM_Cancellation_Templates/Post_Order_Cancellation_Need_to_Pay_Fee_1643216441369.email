Hello,<br />
<br />
Thanks for reaching out to Xometry for assistance on this cancellation request. Because of the timing at hand, we have already incurred the following charges:<br />
<br />
-Return/Restocking Fees for Material and Tooling<br />
-Material Blanked and Cannot Return<br />
-Programming Started<br />
-Fabrication Started<br />
<br />
We currently have this order ON HOLD pending confirmation that it is acceptable to refund (or invoice) all but the cancellation fee.<br />
<br />
If you have any follow up questions upon review, please let us know. If we do not hear back from you, we will proceed to refund the difference at the end of the week.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
