<p>Hello,</p>

<p>We are reaching out to confirm that we have cancelled and refunded this order in full because we are unable to proceed to&nbsp;deliver the components on this order. We have attempted a few emails and&nbsp;any other contact information we have on file, and have not heard back at this point.</p>

<p>It is never our intent to place and order on hold or cancel, but in some circumstances the risk is too high to proceed. Please reach out to us if you have any questions, and thank you again for the opportunity.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks,<br />
&nbsp;</p>
