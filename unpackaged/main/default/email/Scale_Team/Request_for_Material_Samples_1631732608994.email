<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Hello,</span></span>
<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Thanks for reaching out to us. Xometry utilizes a&nbsp;partner network for manufacturing. The partners within that network&nbsp;use a variety of suppliers to purchase materials at the time of order. Because of that, we are unable to provide any material samples. This is actually a benefit to our customers, however&nbsp;because you can choose any&nbsp;commercially available material on the market.&nbsp;We suggest you find a specific material that will meet your needs and submit an RFQ. You can contact the material supplier directly to obtain a sample and we will source from that supplier at time of order.<br />
<br />
<i>Note: Projects that require Xometry to use a specific grade of material or supplier must be manually quoted by our team. If you would like to obtain a manual quote, please select the "custom" material option from our drop down menu and submit an RFQ.&nbsp;</i><br />
<br />
Please let me know if you need additional assistance.</span></span></p>
