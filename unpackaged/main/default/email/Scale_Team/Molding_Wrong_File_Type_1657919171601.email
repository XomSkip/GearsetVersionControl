<br />
Thanks for requesting a quote! I am a member of the Customer Success Team. Unfortunately, we are unable to quote Injection Molding with an STL file. Those are strictly used for 3D printing. Can you please email us over an STP/STEP/X_T file so that we can continue quoting this project?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thank you!&nbsp;
