Thanks for requesting a quote! I am Member of the Customer Success Team here @ Xometry. Metal Extrusion&nbsp;is the manufacturing process of choice when producing high volumes of material with a constant cross-section. This process is not designed for parts at low quantities though. Minimum order QTY is 500. We suggest looking into 3D printing in one of our metal options OR if the part is too large for metal printing (above 9x9x9") we suggest looking into making the part machinable.<br />
<br />
Here are the options we offer for metal printing which will instantly quote on our website:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xometry.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047350694-3D-Printed-Metals" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://support.xometry.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047350694-3D-Printed-Metals</a><br />
