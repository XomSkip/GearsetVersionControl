Thanks for requesting a quote! I am Member of the Customer Success Team here @ Xometry. Die casting is the manufacturing process of choice when producing high volumes of relatively complex metal parts. This process is not designed for parts at low quantities though. Minimum order QTY is 500. We suggest looking into 3D printing in one of our metal options if it's within the build envelope of 9x9x9". Here are the options we offer which will instantly quote on our website:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xometry.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047350694-3D-Printed-Metals" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://support.xometry.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047350694-3D-Printed-Metals</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;If it's larger than this build volume, we suggest looking into making the part design machinable.&nbsp;<br />

Let us know if you have any additional questions.&nbsp;
