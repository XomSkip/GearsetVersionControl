<br />
Thanks for submitting an RFQ to us! I am a member of the Customer Success Team here at Xometry. The DFM feedback on the quote is that you have uploaded a part that's thickness is not a standard gauge size for the material you selected. Here's a link to our standard gauge sizes:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.xometry.com/sheet-cutting/standard-sheet-sizes/">https://www.xometry.com/sheet-cutting/standard-sheet-sizes/</a><br />
<br />
You will need to adjust the thickness of your part to a standard gauge size listed above and re-upload to get an instant quote.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Please let us know if you have any additional questions.&nbsp;</span></span>
