<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;">Hello!&nbsp;<br clear="none" />

Thanks for requesting a quote! I am Member of the Customer Success Team here @ Xometry.&nbsp; Metal stamping is an excellent way to mass-produce complex parts.&nbsp;This process is not designed for parts at low quantities though. Minimum order QTY is 500. We suggest looking into regular sheet metal bending for parts with bends or sheet cutting for flat parts.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Let us know if you have any additional questions.&nbsp;
