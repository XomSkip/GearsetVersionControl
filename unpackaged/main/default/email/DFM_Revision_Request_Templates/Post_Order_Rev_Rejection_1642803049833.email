Hello,<br />
<br />
Thanks for reaching out to Xometry for assistance on this revision request.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, we are already into fabrication, and cannot accommodate your revision request. At this stage, we must follow through on the current order and appreciate your understanding.<br />
<br />
If this revision is essential and new files are required, please reach out to your sales representative, who can assist with setting up a special quote for the remakes that reduces cost to help your project stay on track. We look forward to the next opportunity to serve your manufacturing needs, and apologize that we are unable to accommodate in this instance.<br />
<br />
Best,
