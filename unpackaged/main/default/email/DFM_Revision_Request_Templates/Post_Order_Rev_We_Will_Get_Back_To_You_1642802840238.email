Hello,<br />
<br />
Thanks for reaching out to Xometry for assistance on this revision request!<br />
<br />
We have started production according to our internal records, but we are going to make our best effort to see if there is a chance we can squeeze this request in.<br />
<br />
If manufacturing has started, we will need to proceed on follow through with the order; that said, we will follow up shortly to confirm if we can or cannot accommodate this need and appreciate your patience until we follow up.<br />
<br />
Best,
