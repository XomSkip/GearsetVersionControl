Hello,<br />
<br />
Thanks for reaching out to Xometry for assistance on this finishing request!<br />
<br />
We need to confirm with production that they are capable, and will follow up with any cost or lead time change we need to proceed as requested. In rare cases we do need to follow through with standard finish due to production limitations, but we will try our best to accommodate as always.<br />
<br />
Best,
