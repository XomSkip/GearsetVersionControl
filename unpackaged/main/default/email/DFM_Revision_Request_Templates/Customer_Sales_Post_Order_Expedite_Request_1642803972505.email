We will look into expedites based around shipping, production, and finishing if applicable, and will follow up with what we can achieve shortly. Depending on the current stage of production, we may need to hold our current lead time convervatively. But we will add some notes to the order to ensure any options to expedite that appear are utilized for this order in particular.<br />

We will follow up with a confirmed best delivery date, and any pricing changes (which we will do our best to mitigate) shortly. If you need anything else in the meantime, please do not hesitate to follow up.<br />
