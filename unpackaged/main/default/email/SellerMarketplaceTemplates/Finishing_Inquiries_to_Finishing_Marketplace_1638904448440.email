<p>Hello [customer/partner name],</p>

<p>Thanks for reaching out!&nbsp;I'd be glad to assist you in finding a finishing supplier.<br />
<br />
To get started, you will want to navigate to <a href="https://www.thomasnet.com/suppliers/">https://www.thomasnet.com/suppliers/</a>. Next, select a category in the drop-down menu from product/service, company, or brand. Then, enter your search term and click the Search button (or select from the options in the drop-down menu). From here, you have the option to layer on additional supplier qualifications such as Company Type, Location and Quality Certifications. Once you have made all of your selections, click View Suppliers.</p>

<p>Once you find a shop you want to interact with, simply click the "Request Quote" option in the upper right-hand corner of the shop profile, fill out the pertinent information about your request, and click "Submit Request". Once submitted, the Supplier will review your request and directly provide you a quote or response. You may&nbsp;then transact that finishing work right through the same platform!</p>

<p>As always, we are here to help, so if you have any questions about finding a supplier, creating a project proposal or transacting a quote, donâ€™t hesitate to reach out to us!<br />
