    <description>Can be used for Apex Classes, use this setting to bypass the execution of the necessary logic. Create a new Apex Class Bypass record with the name of the apex class or method you wish to identify. Marking the 'Bypass' checkbox on that record as TRUE will prevent that logic from executing. All classes not identified by Apex Class Bypass records or those where 'Bypass' is marked as FALSE, will execute normally.</description>
