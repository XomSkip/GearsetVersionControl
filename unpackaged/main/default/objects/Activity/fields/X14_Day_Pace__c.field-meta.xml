    <description>Calculates if this was created within the last 14 days (excluding today) and before the time right now. E.g. if it's 11:34 AM, and the record was created at 11:33 AM yesterday, this will return true; if the record was created at 11:35 AM, it will return false.

Note: "midnight" is Eastern time; formula splits the difference between Daylight Time and Standard Time, so it starts counting at 12:30 AM during DST, and 11:30 PM while in standard time.</description>
